Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer:
No, Java does not allow you to create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Because title and constructor are both string, when these constructors are created, they will have the same signature
