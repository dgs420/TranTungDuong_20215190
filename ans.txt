- If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?

What class should implement the Comparable interface?
- Class Media and its class that inherited from it.

Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
 - No we can't.

Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
